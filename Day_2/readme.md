## [Lonely Integer](Lonely_Integer)

Given an array of integers, where all elements but one occur twice, find the unique element.

## [Diagonal Difference](Diagonal_Difference)

Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

## [Counting Sort 1](Counting_Sort_1)

Quicksort usually has a running time of  `n log(n)` , but is there an algorithm that can sort even faster? In general, this is not possible. Most sorting algorithms are comparison sorts, i.e. they sort a list just by comparing the elements to one another. A comparison sort algorithm cannot beat `n log(n)`  (worst-case) running time, since  `n log(n)`  represents the minimum number of comparisons needed to know where to place each element. For more details, you can see [these notes](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~avrim/451f11/lectures/lect0913.pdf) (PDF).

## [Flipping The Matrix](Flipping_The_Matrix)

Sean invented a game involving a `2n x 2n` matrix where each cell of the matrix contains an integer. He can reverse any of its rows or columns any number of times. The goal of the game is to maximize the sum of the elements in the  submatrix located in the upper-left quadrant of the matrix.

Given the initial configurations for `q` matrices, help Sean reverse the rows and columns of each matrix in the best possible way so that the sum of the elements in the matrix's upper-left quadrant is maximal.
