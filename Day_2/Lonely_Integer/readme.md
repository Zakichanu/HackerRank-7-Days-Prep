# Lonely Integer

Given an array of integers, where all elements but one occur twice, find the unique element.

## Example

Given the array `[6, 1, 3, 3, 3, 6, 6]`, return `1`. Given the array `[13, 19, 13, 13]`, return `19`.

## Function Description

Complete the function `lonelyinteger` in the editor below. It should return the integer which occurs only once in the input array.

`lonelyinteger` has the following parameter(s):

- `a`: an array of integers

## Returns

- `int`: the element that occurs only once

## Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, `n`, denoting the number of integers in the array.
The second line contains `n` space-separated integers describing the values in `a`.

## Constraints

- `1 <= n < 100`

- `0 <= a[i] <= 100`, where `0 <= i < n`.

- It is guaranteed that `n` is an odd number and that there is one unique element.
